            <h2>Anchorage, Alaska</h2>
            <p> I was born at the AFB Elmendorf in Anchorage.
               Dad was in the Army, I have an older brother who was also born in Alaska.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h2>French Lick, Indiana</h2>
            <p> Not too many memories here. We lived here when I was very little
               and before my dad returned to the Army. He was medically discharged for a couple years.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h2>Fort Hood, Texas</h2>
            <p> Lived here from around the ages of 4 to 7. I went to two different
               elementary schools and this is where I adopted my first two dogs. We had to rehome Pongo because he was
               too much for our family to handle
               and we kept Copper since he was small and could easily make the constant road trips involved
               with moving in the military. Copper was a basset hound mix and was named after the hound in 'Fox and the
               Hound'.</p>

         <section>
            <h2>Fort Wainwright, Alaska</h2>
            <p> Ended up driving all the way back up to Alaska. I think it took like two weeks.
               It was pretty scary back then, the Alaskan Highway and going through Canada. There was maybe one
               emergency landline and the rest just wilderness. Recess at school was often cancelled because of the
               plenty bears
               and moose. Don't fuck with either.
               DO NOT go near a moose. They are bigger than you think and will curb stomp you, your ancestors and
               your car.
            </p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h2>Fort Polk, Louisiana</h2>
            <p> Moved here after Alaska. On our way to Louisiana we stopped to visit Indiana and there we adopted
               another dog off a farm. Her name was Bear, we later learned she was a Belgian Groenendael. Super athletic
               and smart.
               It was okay, Louisiana history class was literally just nothin but Mardi
               Gras history and Gumbo day. Also they still hit kids with wooden paddles and still have drive-thru liquor
               stores. Our mascot was The Red Devils, which was weird considering how religious everyone was and the
               locals protesting the mascot name all the time. And you can buy gator heads and voodoo dolls at gas
               stations. Dad refused to let us go to New Orleans with friends, believed everyday there was Mardi Gras.
               Shortly affter we PCS'ed
               Katrina happened and wiped the city out. Still a little mad about that. Schools including my old one were
               over populated from the families that had to leave the city.

         <section>
            <h2>Fort Leonardwood, Missouri</h2>
            <p>Weirdly ended up going to three different schools while here. Didn't enjoy Missouri. They did have very
               awesome museums in St. Louis,
               and we got to go up the St. Louis Arch for a field trip. If you are severely claustrophobic I do not
               recommend. Scrawny teenagers could barely
               cram into the small pods and you could hear people screaming in the others. Overall a mild to moderately
               terrifying ride depending on individual fear intensity.</p>
         </section>
         <section>
            <h2>Fort Lewis and Seattle, Washington</h2>
            <p>Longest I ever lived in one spot. Dad retired here. Fort Lewis was the last base I ever lived on.
               Ended up living in 3 different housing assignments, our first home was destroyed by a felled tree during
               a windstorm. Then we had temporary housing before we moved again into the permanent housing.
               After retirement, family got a house and I spent my late teens and adulthood in Washington. My dog Copper
               lived to be 19 years old and my girl Bear made it to 15. <br>
               Eventually landed a job in Seattle as a licensed veterinary technician at a cancer research facility. I
               really enjoyed my job, it was niche,
               but I didnt have to deal with customers only the occasional crazy Primary Investigator or Research
               Technician. Met my husband in Seattle, he was transferred by his company
               from New Jersey to manage a lab in Seattle. We worked a block from each other. Eventually we adopted a
               dog from our colony.
               6 years later we were able to get his sister and bring her to New Jersey.

            <h2>Voorhees, New Jersey</h2>
            <p> Moved to New Jersey because my husband wanted to be near his family and ailing grandma. I had plans to
               work at a lab, my old
               Comparative Medicine Director was from New Jersey and was willing to help me find a place when we
               settled. Except the moment we moved in, I got sick.
               And I got worse. And I had no health care, losing my insane 0 deductible, 0 out of pocket, pay for
               nothing but $25 co-pay health insurance because I had quit my job to move.
               My job supplied us with full coverage healthcare, fmla, and dental and vision and so many things. Then I
               got sick, and didnt have any of those things. Turns out the east coast doctors
               like treating everyone like a drug addict and they like to gaslight patients. Lucky me I knew medical
               stuff, except it still took 2.5 years, dozens of doctors, multiple hospitals and a few hospitilizations
               to finaly get diagnosed. <br>
               Also learned New Jersey has no labor laws, only the federal level which is
               literally nothing. Ya'll dont get mandated breaks or sick time or PTO? Wtf. I tried to work at a simple
               ass job because of my
               health and learned
               that; employers don't help with healthcare coverage, dental offices don't actually understand how to
               sterilize instruments correctly, breaks arent legally mandated, and the kids under 18 weren't getting the
               federally protected lunch breaks.
               Ya'll are treated like absolute garbage here and you guys are okay with that? And when my car broke down
               and needed a jump not a single person would help amongst other more confrontational problems I've had
               here. Seattle gets a
               weird reputation , the "Seattle freeze" , but they are helpful and nice motherfuckers compared to here.
               You get a naked guy
               in a tree once in a while and weed is legal. If I was a religious person I'd say Jersey needs Jesus. <br>
               Anyway, still sick, unemployed, in medical debt and trying to restart my entire life
               from scratch because no one actually gives a fuck about sick people, which was sadly reinforced during
               the pandemic. The irony lies in the fact my job was doing medical studies which
               required massive amounts of different immunosuppressants and the occasional radioactive isotope. And
               literally raising "Bubble Boy" dogs, so I know the side effects and consequences of what happens when
               your immune system isn't working.
               Guess who's going through the immunosuppressant gambit now? This girl&reg;.
