               <h2 class="headings">Anchorage, Alaska</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph"> I was born at the AFB Elmendorf in Anchorage.
                  Dad was in the Army, I have an older brother who was also born in Alaska.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2 class="headings">French Lick, Indiana</h2>
               <p> Not too many memories here. We lived here when I was very little
                  and before my dad returned to the Army. He was medically discharged for a couple years.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2 class="headings">Fort Hood, Texas</h2>
               <p> Lived here from around the ages of 4 to 7. I went to two different
                  elementary schools and this is where I adopted my first two dogs. We had to rehome Pongo because he
                  was
                  too much for our family to handle and we kept Copper since he was small and could easily make the
                  constant road trips involved
                  with moving in the military. Copper was a basset hound mix and was named after the hound in 'Fox and
                  the
                  Hound'.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
               <h2 class="headings">Fort Wainwright, Alaska</h2>
               <p> Ended up driving all the way back up to Alaska. I think it took like two weeks.
                  It was pretty scary back then, the Alaskan Highway and going through Canada. There was maybe one
                  emergency landline and the rest just wilderness. Recess at school was often cancelled because of the
                  plenty bears and moose. Don't fuck with either.
                  DO NOT go near a moose. They are bigger than you think and will curb stomp you, your ancestors and
                  your car.

            <section>
               <h2 class="headings">Fort Polk, Louisiana</h2>
               <p> Moved here after Alaska. On our way to Louisiana we stopped to visit Indiana and there we adopted
                  another dog off a farm. Her name was Bear, we later learned she was a Belgian Groenendael. Super
                  athletic
                  and smart.
                  It was okay, Louisiana history class was literally just nothin but Mardi
                  Gras history and Gumbo day. Also they still hit kids with wooden paddles and still have drive-thru
                  liquor
                  stores. Our mascot was The Red Devils, which was weird considering how religious everyone was and the
                  locals protesting the mascot name all the time. And you can buy gator heads and voodoo dolls at gas
                  stations. Dad refused to let us go to New Orleans with friends, believed everyday there was Mardi
                  Gras.
                  Shortly affter we PCS'ed Katrina happened and wiped the city out. Still a little mad about that.

               <h2 class="headings">Fort Leonardwood, Missouri</h2>
               <p>Weirdly ended up going to three different schools while here. Didn't enjoy Missouri. They did have
                  very
                  awesome museums in St. Louis,
                  and we got to go up the St. Louis Arch for a field trip. If you are severely claustrophobic I do not
                  recommend. Scrawny teenagers could barely
                  cram into the small pods and you could hear people screaming in the others. Overall a mild to
                  moderately
                  terrifying ride depending on individual fear intensity.</p>

            <section>
               <h2 class="headings">Fort Lewis and Seattle, Washington</h2>
               <p>Longest I ever lived in one spot. Dad retired here. Fort Lewis was the last base I ever lived on.
                  Ended up living in 3 different housing assignments, our first home was destroyed by a felled tree
                  during
                  a windstorm. Then we had temporary housing before we moved again into the permanent housing.
                  After retirement, family got a house and I spent my late teens and adulthood in Washington. My dog
                  Copper
                  lived to be 19 years old and my girl Bear made it to 15. <br>
                  Eventually landed a job in Seattle as a licensed veterinary technician at a cancer research facility.
                  I
                  really enjoyed my job, it was niche,
                  but I didnt have to deal with customers, only the occasional crazy Primary Investigator or Research
                  Technician. Met my husband in Seattle, he was transferred by his company
                  from New Jersey to manage a lab in Seattle. We worked a block from each other. Eventually we adopted a
                  dog from our colony.
                  6 years later we were able to get his sister and bring her to New Jersey.

            <section>
               <h2 class="headings">Voorhees, New Jersey</h2>
               <p> Moved to New Jersey because my husband wanted to be near his family and ailing grandma. I had plans
                  to work at a lab, my old Comparative Medicine Director was from New Jersey and was willing to help me
                  find a place when we
                  settled. Except the moment we moved in, I got sick.
                  And I got worse. And we had no health care, because I had quit my job to move.
                  My job supplied us with full coverage healthcare, fmla, and dental and vision and so many things. Then
                  I got sick and didnt have any of those things. Turns out New Jersey doctors
                  like treating everyone like a drug addict and they like to gaslight patients. <em>Lucky</em> me I knew
                  medical
                  stuff, except it still took 2.5 years, dozens of doctors, multiple hospitals and a few
                  hospitilizations to finaly get diagnosed. <br>
                  Also learned New Jersey has no labor laws, only the federal level which is
                  literally nothing. Ya'll dont get mandated breaks or sick time or PTO? Wtf.
                  Ya'll are treated like absolute garbage here and everyones okay with that?
                  Sure in Seattle you get a naked guy in a tree once in a while, but people are
                  nice (except 3rd and Pine, always avoid 3rd and Pine) and employees have rights. <br>
                  Anyway, still sick, unemployed, in medical debt and trying to restart my entire life
                  from scratch because no one actually cares about sick people, which was sadly reinforced during
                  the pandemic. The irony lies in the fact my job was doing medical studies which
                  required massive amounts of different immunosuppressants and the occasional radioactive isotope. I
                  literally raised animals with no immune system, so I know the side effects and consequences of what
                  happens when your immune system isn't working.
                  Guess who's going through the immunosuppressant gambit now? This girl&reg;.
